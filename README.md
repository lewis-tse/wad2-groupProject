# PTFinder - WAD2
Lab 9 - Team E Group Project

## Description

Django based web application for people to find, book and review personal trainers.

## How-To Contribute

I've setup using Anaconda Prompt so these instructions apply to that not cmd.
First move to the directory that you have cloned the repo into.
Then:
```
conda create -n ptfinder python=3.7.2
```

Once you are in the groupProject venv run the following commands:
```
pip install django
pip install pillow
```

Then to test that your install works do:
```
cd ptfinder
```
then,
```
python manage.py runserver
```
finally simply go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to test.
